		<p> I am currently working in a group with two other designers to create a logo for the company Good L'Oven Cookie Shop and McCandless Townships' 175th anniversary.</p>
		<p>We have been creating logos for Good L'Oven since the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year. Currently, we are narrowing down the options for a final logo.</p>
		<p>Our work with McCandless township started at the end of April in 2025. We have been working on the thumbnail process for a few weeks, and we recently sent them our sketches.</p>
		
		<div class="desktop">
			<p>We were excited when both Good Lâ€™Oven and McCandless Township chose A.W. Beattie students to design their new logos. This opportunity allowed me to learn more about the world of design outside of school. This experience allowed me to learn more about how to eloquently explain design concepts and better communicate with clients and my teammates.</p>
